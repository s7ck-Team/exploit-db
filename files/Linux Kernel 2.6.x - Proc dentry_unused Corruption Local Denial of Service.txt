The Linux kernel is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue is due to a flaw in the 'proc' filesystem.

This vulnerability allows local users to cause a kernel panic, denying further service to legitimate users.

This issue affects Linux kernel versions 2.6.15 through 2.6.17-rc5 on multiprocessor computers running SMP kernels. Other kernel versions may also be affected.
