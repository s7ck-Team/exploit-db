It has been reported that GWeb is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. The issue is due to the server's failure to properly validate user supplied http requests.

This issue may allow an attacker to escape the web server root directory and view any web server readable files. Information acquired by exploiting this issue may be used to aid further attacks against a vulnerable system.
