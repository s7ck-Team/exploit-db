<nemo> i had to be in a .txt
<nemo> i'm glad it's this one :p
<nemo> and not my ~/

Summer is here in its full joyous being. Let us all relax and enjoy ourselves. 
Let us have fun. Write some obfuscations. Play some golf. Write fun code and 
have fun coding and critiquing with your friends. Read and laugh. This issue 
is less talk and more code. This is Perl Underground 3.

Would you like some cheap 0day obfuscation?

-[0x04] # School You: japhy ----------------------------------------------

"Open, Sesame!"
If you've used Perl for a week, you're probably familiar with the task of opening a file, either to
read from or write to it. Here's a simple refresher course for you -- some of it involves Perl 5.6,
which lets you do some nifty things with open(). There are three basic operations you use a
filehandle for: reading, writing, and appending. You can also read and write (or read and append)
to files, and you can read from to write to a program (from its output, or to its input).

# error-checking would, of course, be used

open FILE, "filename";	    # read
open FILE, "< filename";    # read (explicit)
open FILE, "> filename";    # overwrite
open FILE, ">> filename";   # append
open FILE, "+< filename";   # read and write
open FILE, "+> filename";   # read and overwrite (clobber first)
open FILE, "+>> filename";  # read and append
open FILE, "program |";     # read from program
open FILE, "| program";     # write to program
For safety's sake, the explicit forms should always be used, and with a space between the mode and
the filename. Here's an example of why:

chomp(my $filename = <STDIN>);
open FILE, $filename;
This allows the user pass anything from "< /etc/passwd" to "rm -rf / |" to your open() call,
neither of which you'd be too happy to permit. For the same reason, using open(F, ">$filename")
isn't enough either -- the user could slip an extra > in on you and cause you to append, rather
than overwrite.

Perl 5.6 allows an even greater extent of control: a multi-argument form of open():

# open FILEHANDLE, MODE, EXPR

open FILE, "<", $filename;  # read from $filename
If you want to pipe to a program, the MODE should be "|-"; if you want to pipe from a program, the
MODE should be "-|". In the case of call programs, you can send a list of arguments after the
program name:

# open FILEHANDLE, MODE, EXPR, LIST

open LS, "-|", "ls", "-R";
That invokes ls with the -R switch (for recursive listing), and returns the output to Perl.

Finally, Perl 5.6 allows you to use an undefined lexical (a my variable) in the place of the
filehandle. This allows you to use filehandles as variables more easily -- using them in objects,
passing them to functions, etc.

for my $f (@listing) {
  open my($fh), "<", $f;
  push @files, $fh;
}
Obfuscorner
If you only send a filehandle to open(), Perl will look for a package variable (not a lexical) of
the same name, and use the value of that variable as the filename to open. A simple use of this is
to open the program itself; since $0 holds the name of the program, you can simply write:

open 0;  # like:  open 0, $0
Whose Line Is It, Anyway?
Files are not made up of lines. Files are made up of sequential bytes. A "line" is a made-up
concept which only applies to text files (who cares how many "lines" there are in a JPEG?). The
standard definition of a line is a sequence of zero or more bytes ending with a newline. Whether
that is \n or \r\n or \n\r is up to your OS to decide. But who cares about "lines"? Perl is more
interested in records.

A record is a sequence of bytes separated from other records by some other sequence of bytes. A
"line" is merely a record with a separator \n (or whatever). What good are records, though, if Perl
keeps reading lines? Well, just tell Perl not to read a line!

open FORTUNE, "< /usr/share/games/fortunes/art";
{
  local $/ = "\n%\n";
  @fortunes = <FORTUNE>;
}
close FORTUNE;
This code makes use of the $/ variable -- the "input record separator" -- to change how much each
read of <FORTUNE> does. Instead of stopping at "\n", it stops at "\n%\n" (the separator of my
computer's fortune files). This means that we can read multiple "lines" at once. In fact, Perl has
two special values of $/ explicitly for that purpose:
Setting $/ to "" causes Perl to use "paragraph" mode; it will read a chunk of lines that is
followed by extra newlines -- in other words, a sequence of bytes ending in two or more newlines.
Setting $/ to undef causes Perl to read the rest of the file all at once.
In addition to the record-separator use of $/, you can set it to a reference to a positive integer,
which means that you will read that many bytes at on each read:

while (read(FILE, $buf, 1024)) { ... }

# is like

{
  local $/ = \1024;
  while ($buf = <FILE>) { ... }
}
If you're wondering why I continually local()ize $/, it is to make sure that the change to $/ are
restricted to where we want it. We don't want future filehandle-reads to be using the changed
value.

The $/ variable is also used by chomp() -- this function doesn't just remove a newline from the end
of its arguments, it removes the value of $/ from the end of them (if it's there).
Outputting Records
There are a couple of variables related to printing records as well. The $\ variable (the output
record separator) and the $, variable (the output field separator). The mnemonics for these two are
rather simple:
$\ goes where you put a \n in your print()
$, goes where you put a , in your print()
The fact that $\ and $/ share a mirrored character is not a mistake either -- they are related in
that each is the other's opposite.

How are they useful? They let you be obscenely lazy. Let's say you're playing with the /etc/passwd
file:

open PASSWD, "/etc/passwd"
  or die "can't read /etc/passwd: $!";
open MOD, "> /etc/weirdpasswd"
  or die "can't write to /etc/weirdpasswd: $!";

$\ = $/;   # ORS = IRS = "\n"
$, = ":";  # OFS = ","

while (<PASSWD>) {
  chomp;  # removes $/ from $_
  my @f = split $,;  # splits $_ on occurrences of $,
  # fool around with @f
  print MOD @f;
}

close MOD;
close PASSWD;
If we hadn't set $\ and $, in this code, the output file would have been one long line of fields,
with nothing in between each field, and no way to separate one record from the next. However, since
we have set them, we automatically append $\ to each print() statement, and automatically insert $,
in between each argument to print(). Here's the explicit code that doesn't use these two variables:

while (<PASSWD>) {
  chomp;
  my @f = split ':';
  # fool around with @f
  print MOD join(':', @f), "\n";
}
While that may end up being more clear than the other, it's only that way because you've not been
exposed to the variables. I'm sure before you learned how to use $_, your code was a lot more
verbose; but once you embrace that default variable, code like

for my $line (@lines) {
  chomp $line;
  my @fields = split /=/, $line;
  for my $f (@fields) { $f =~ s/->/: /; }
  # ...
}
became code like

for (@lines) {
  chomp;
  my @fields = split /=/;
  for (@fields) { s/->/:/ }
  # ...
}
It's the same with these other variables.
While We're Being Lazy...
There's no variable that symbolizes the default filehandle to print to -- if you print() with no
filehandle mentioned, Perl assumes you mean to print to STDOUT.

Well, not necessarily. The default output handle can be changed. Its default value is STDOUT, but
you can change that with the select() function:

print "to stdout\n";
my $oldfh = select MOD;
print "to mod\n";
select $oldfh;
print "to stdout\n";
Assuming you start out with STDOUT as your default output handle, the code runs as is described.
The select() function (in the single argument form) takes a filehandle, sets it as the default, and
returns the previously select()ed filehandle.

You can call select() with no arguments, and it will merely return the current default filehandle
(as an information source).
Huffering, Puffering, and Buffering
Another useful filehandle variable is $| the autoflush variable. This variable is unique for each
filehandle -- output to STDERR is flushed automatically, but output to STDOUT is not. This variable
is a true boolean -- it either holds a true value (which gets stored as 1) or a false value (which
gets stored as 0).

Buffering is the process of storing output until a certain condition is reached (such as a newline
is encountered). When a buffer is flushed, its contents are emptied. Where do they go? Well, to the
filehandle proper. A buffer is a temporary holding location between the process generating the
output and the place the output will appear.

Like I said, each filehandle has its own buffer control. To set the autoflush variable for a given
filehandle, you have to use select(), or the standard IO::Handle module's autoflush method.

# turn on autoflushing for OUT
{
  my $old = select OUT;
  $| = 1;
  select $old;
}

# another way, using IO::Handle
use IO::Handle;
autoflush OUT 1;
The IO::Handle module offers many helpful methods for filehandles (which are internally objects of
the IO::Handle class). You might want to see what else it has to offer that you might want to use.

You can make your own per-filehandle variables via the Tie::PerFH module, available on CPAN.
Obfuscorner
In the evil Perl spirit of "there's more than one way to do it", there's an obfuscated way to turn
on autoflushing for a filehandle. It combines the three lines (save the old handle, set $|, restore
the old handle) into one:

select((select(OUT), $|=1)[0]);
The dissection of this code is as follows:
select(OUT) makes OUT the default handle and returns the previous handle
$| = 1 sets autoflush to true, after the select(OUT) has been executed
(select(OUT), $|=1)[0] is a list slice -- it takes the first element of the list (select(OUT),
$|=1), which is the value returned by select(OUT) (the previous filehandle)
select(...) makes that value the default filehandle -- and what is ...? it's the first element of
the list (described above)
Delightfully icky!

Another trick is to take advantage of the fact $| is always either 0 or 1. If it's 0, and you
subtract 1, -1 is transformed into 1. Subtracting 1 again gives you 0 again. Thus, $|-- is a
builtin flip-flop!

# alternate indenting and not indenting lines
for (@data) {
  print "  " x $|--;
  print "$_\n";
}
This doesn't work with $|++... can you see why?
The Magic of <>
The final mystery revealed is a lengthy one. We all know we can read input via <STDIN>. But what
about the mysterious empty diamond operator, <>? What does it do, and how can we interact with its
magic?

The empty diamond operator is related to @ARGV, $ARGV, the ARGV filehandle, the ARGVOUT filehandle,
and $^I. You probably know one of these (@ARGV) already. The others will soon be made clear. First
here's a sample program:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# inplace.pl ext code [files]
# ex: inplace.pl .bak '$_ = "" if /^#/' *.pl

use strict;

$^I = shift;
my $code = shift;

while (<>) {
  eval $code;
  print;
}
All the following symbols are strict-safe.
@ARGV
the list of command-line arguments to your program
when using <>, Perl uses these arguments as sources of input (so you can read from "ls |"!)
if the array is empty to begin with, Perl puts "-" in there, which means "read from STDIN"
when a file is being read, it is removed (shift()ed) from the array
$ARGV
this holds the input source currently begin read from
ARGV
this is the filehandle opened, using $ARGV
ARGVOUT
if $^I is not undef, this is the output filehandle being printed to
it is select()ed automatically
$^I
this is the in-place editing backup extension variable, and can be set from the command-line via
the -i switch
if this isn't undef, the loop will read from ARGV and write to ARGVOUT
if it contains the "*" character, the value is not an extension, but the new name of the file (so
if modifying foo.txt and $^I is "old-*", the backup file is old-foo.txt)
Knowing this, our code can be written rather explicitly. You're about to see why Perl is so nice to
you.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my $ext = shift;
my $code = shift;

@ARGV = '-' unless @ARGV;

FILE:
while (defined($ARGV = shift)) {
  my $backup;

  # if we're not working with STDIN...
  if ($ARGV ne '-') {
    # get backup filename
    if ($ext =~ /\*/) { ($backup = $ext) =~ s/\*/$ARGV/ }
    else { $backup = "$ARGV$ext" }

    # try renaming file
    rename $ARGV => $backup or
      warn("Can't rename $ARGV to $backup: $!, skipping file.") and
      next FILE;
  }

  # with STDIN, there's no real backup done
  else { $backup = '-' }

  open ARGV, "< $backup" or
    warn("Can't open $backup: $!") and
    next FILE;

  # if we're not dealing with STDIN,
  # but $backup is $ARGV, we're doing real
  # in-place editing, so we use a Unix trick:
  #   * open the file for reading
  #   * unlink it
  #   * open the file for writing
  # this is a miracle, but it fails in DOS :(

  if ($backup ne '-' and $backup eq $ARGV) {
    unlink $backup or
      warn("Can't remove $backup: $!, skipping file.") and
      next FILE;
  }

  open ARGVOUT, "> $ARGV" or
    warn("(panic) Can't write $ARGV: $!, skipping file.") and
    next FILE;

  while (<ARGV>) {
    eval $code;
    print ARGVOUT;
  }

  close ARGVOUT;
  # note: we don't close ARGV!
}
Aren't you glad Perl does all that hard work for you?

Now that you know about these symbols, you can use some of them to your advantage. Here's a bit of
code that prints each line of input with the source and the line number in front of it. Notice,
though, that since the code that Perl uses never closes ARGV, the $. variable never gets reset to
0. That means the line count keeps increasing:

while (<>) {
  print "$ARGV ($.): $_";
}
If we have two files, a.txt and b.txt whose contents are "abc\ndef\nghi\n" and "jkl\nmno\n"
respectively, this program outputs:


a.txt (1): abc
a.txt (2): def
a.txt (3): ghi
b.txt (4): jkl
b.txt (5): mno
Now, what if we want the line number to be reset for each new file? We need to be able to detect
the end of the file. We can do that with the eof() function! There are two ways we can use the
function for detecting the end of each input:

while (<>) {
  print "$ARGV ($.): $_";
  close ARGV if eof;  # reset $.
}

# or

while (<>) {
  print "$ARGV ($.): $_";
  close ARGV if eof(ARGV);  # reset $.
}
If you don't use any parentheses, and don't send an argument, Perl will check the last filehandle
read from. If you send an argument, it checks that filehandle. "But japhy! What about eof()?" you
ask? Well, that's a very special case. If you want to know when you've reached the end of all the
input, you can use eof():

while (<>) {
  print "$ARGV ($.): $_";
  print "==end==\n" if eof();  # after ALL data
}
Lazy Loops
In addition to the -i switch, Perl offers switches like -n and -p, which construct loops around the
source of your code:

perl -ne 'print if /foo/' files
# becomes
perl -e 'while (<>) { print if /foo/ }' files

perl -pe 's/foo/bar/' files
# becomes
perl -e 'while (<>) { s/foo/bar/ } continue { print }' files
You can use -p with -i to write a simple one-liner file editor:

# keep backups
perl -pi.bak -e 's/PERL/Perl/g' files

# don't keep backups
perl -pi -e 's/PERL/Perl/g' files
Why do you think you have to say -pi -e, and can't use -pie?

# SCO Openserver 5.0.7 enable exploit
# ===================================
# A standard stack-overflow exists in the handling of
# command line arguements in the 'enable' binary. A user
# must be configured with the correct permissions to
# use the "enable" binary. SCO user documentation suggests
# "You can use the asroot(ADM) command. In order to grant a
# user the right to enable and disable tty devices". This
# exploit assumes you have those permissions.
#
# Example.
# 
# $ id
# uid=200(user) gid=50(group) groups=50(group)
# $ perl enablex.pl
# # id
# uid=0(root) gid=50(group) egid=18(lp) groups=50(group)

# Now the question of the hour, will this get rm'd when someone posts it to .aware public ftp?

# K-sPecial is a rapid and effective coder. He also completely lacks formal Perl learning
# He's learned piece by piece, but has missed much and could benefit from some reeducation
# He makes it work, and knows a lot of tricks
# but this code is new, and all your virtues won't save you from a little rubbing this time

# no shebang line?
# I guess you fill your pound quota below

## Creator: K-sPecial (xzziroz.net) of .aware (awarenetwork.org)
## Name: GUESTEX-exec.pl
## Date: 06/07/2006
## Version: 1.00
##  1.00 (06/07/2006) - GUESTEX-exec.pl created
## 
## Description: GUESTEX guestbook is vulnerable to remote code execution in how it 
##  handles it's 'email' parameter. $form{'email'} is used when openning a pipe to 
##  sendmail in this manner: open(MAIL, "$sendmail $form{'email'}) where $form{'email'} 
##  is not properly sanitized.
##
## Usage: specify the host and location of the script as the first argument. hosts can 
##  contain ports (host:port) and you CAN specify a single command to execute via the 
##  commandline, although if you do not you will be given a shell like interface to 
##  repeatedly enter commands.

Test::MockRandom -  Replaces random number generation with non-random number
generation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # intercept rand in another package
  use Test::MockRandom 'Some::Other::Package';
  use Some::Other::Package; # exports sub foo { return rand }
  srand(0.13);
  foo(); # returns 0.13
  
  # using a seed list and "oneish"
  srand(0.23, 0.34, oneish() );
  foo(); # returns 0.23
  foo(); # returns 0.34
  foo(); # returns a number just barely less than one
  foo(); # returns 0, as the seed array is empty
  
  # object-oriented, for use in the current package
  use Test::MockRandom ();
  my $nrng = Test::MockRandom->new(0.42, 0.23);
  $nrng->rand(); # returns 0.42
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This perhaps ridiculous-seeming module was created to test routines that
manipulate random numbers by providing a known output from C<rand>.  Given a
list of seeds with C<srand>, it will return each in turn.  After seeded random
numbers are exhausted, it will always return 0.  Seed numbers must be of a form
that meets the expected output from C<rand> as called with no arguments -- i.e.
they must be between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).  In order to facilitate
generating and testing a nearly-one number, this module exports the function
C<oneish>, which returns a number just fractionally less than one.  

Depending on how this module is called with C<use>, it will export C<rand> to a
specified package (e.g. a class being tested) effectively overriding and
intercepting calls in that package to the built-in C<rand>.  It can also
override C<rand> in the current package or even globally.  In all
of these cases, it also exports C<srand> and C<oneish> to the current package
in order to control the output of C<rand>.  See L</USAGE> for details.

Alternatively, this module can be used to generate objects, with each object
maintaining its own distinct seed array.

=head1 USAGE

By default, Test::MockRandom does not export any functions.  This still allows
object-oriented use by calling C<Test::MockRandom-E<gt>new(@seeds)>.  In order
for Test::MockRandom to be more useful, arguments must be provided during the
call to C<use>.

=head2 C<use Test::MockRandom 'Target::Package'>

The simplest way to intercept C<rand> in another package is to provide the
name(s) of the package(s) for interception as arguments in the C<use>
statement.  This will export C<rand> to the listed packages and will export
C<srand> and C<oneish> to the current package to control the behavior of
C<rand>.  You B<must> C<use> Test::MockRandom before you C<use> the target
package.  This is a typical case for testing a module that uses random numbers:

 use Test::More 'no_plan';
 use Test::MockRandom 'Some::Package';
 BEGIN { use_ok( Some::Package ) }
 
 # assume sub foo { return rand } was imported from Some::Package
 
 srand(0.5)
 is( foo(), 0.5, "is foo() 0.5?") # test gives "ok"

If multiple package names are specified, C<rand> will be exported to all
of them.

If you wish to export C<rand> to the current package, simply provide
C<__PACKAGE__> as the parameter for C<use>, or C<main> if importing
to a script without a specified package.  This can be part of a
list provided to C<use>.  All of the following idioms work:

 use Test::MockRandom qw( main Some::Package ); # Assumes a script
 use Test::MockRandom __PACKAGE__, 'Some::Package';

 # The following doesn't interpolate __PACKAGE__ as above, but 
 # Test::MockRandom will still DWIM and handle it correctly

 use Test::MockRandom qw( __PACKAGE__ Some::Package );

=head2 C<use Test::MockRandom { %customized }>

As an alternative to a package name as an argument to C<use>,
Test::MockRandom will also accept a hash reference with a custom
set of instructions for how to export functions:

 use Test::MockRandom {
    rand   => [ Some::Package, {Another::Package => 'random'} ],
    srand  => { Another::Package => 'seed' }, 
    oneish => __PACKAGE__
 };

The keys of the hash may be any of C<rand>, C<srand>, and C<oneish>.  The
values of the hash give instructions for where to export the symbol
corresponding to the key.  These are interpreted as follows, depending on their
type:

=over

=item *

String: a package to which Test::MockRandom will export the symbol

=item *

Hash Reference: the key is the package to which Test::MockRandom will export
the symbol and the value is the name under which it will be exported

=item *

Array Reference: a list of strings or hash references which will be handled
as above

=back

=head2 C<Test::MockRandom-E<gt>export_rand_to( 'Target::Package' =E<gt> 'rand_alias' )>

In order to intercept the built-in C<rand> in another package, 
Test::MockRandom must export its own C<rand> function to the 
target package B<before> the target package is compiled, thus overriding
calls to the built-in.  The simple approach (described above) of providing the
target package name in the C<use Test::MockRandom> statement accomplishes this
because C<use> is equivalent to a C<require> and C<import> within a C<BEGIN>
block.  To explicitly intercept C<rand> in another package, you can also call
C<export_rand_to>, but it must be enclosed in a C<BEGIN> block of its own.  The
explicit form also support function aliasing just as with the custom approach
with C<use>, described above:

 use Test::MockRandom;
 BEGIN {Test::MockRandom->export_rand_to('AnotherPackage'=>'random')}
 use AnotherPackage;
 
This C<BEGIN> block must not include a C<use> statement for the package to be
intercepted, or perl will compile the package to be intercepted before the
C<export_rand_to> function has a chance to execute and intercept calls to 
the built-in C<rand>.  This is very important in testing.  The C<export_rand_to>
call must be in a separate C<BEGIN> block from a C<use> or C<use_ok> test,
which should be enclosed in a C<BEGIN> block of its own: 
 
 use Test::More tests => 1;
 use Test::MockRandom;
 BEGIN { Test::MockRandom->export_rand_to( 'AnotherPackage' ); }
 BEGIN { use_ok( 'AnotherPackage' ); }

Given these cautions, it's probably best to use either the simple or custom
approach with C<use>, which does the right thing in most circumstances.  Should
additional explicit customization be necessary, Test::MockRandom also provides
C<export_srand_to> and C<export_oneish_to>.

=head2 Overriding C<rand> globally: C<use Test::MockRandom 'CORE::GLOBAL'>

This is just like intercepting C<rand> in a package, except that you
do it globally by overriding the built-in function in C<CORE::GLOBAL>. 

 use Test::MockRandom 'CORE::GLOBAL';
 
 # or

 BEGIN { Test::MockRandom->export_rand_to('CORE::GLOBAL') }

You can always access the real, built-in C<rand> by calling it explicitly as
C<CORE::rand>.

=head2 Intercepting C<rand> in a package that also contains a C<rand> function

This is tricky as the order in which the symbol table is manipulated will lead
to very different results.  This can be done safely (maybe) if the module uses
the same rand syntax/prototype as the system call but offers them up as method
calls which resolve at run-time instead of compile time.  In this case, you
will need to do an explicit intercept (as above) but do it B<after> importing
the package.  I.e.:

 use Test::MockRandom 'SomeRandPackage';
 use SomeRandPackage;
 BEGIN { Test::MockRandom->export_rand_to('SomeRandPackage');

The first line is necessary to get C<srand> and C<oneish> exported to
the current package.  The second line will define a C<sub rand> in 
C<SomeRandPackage>, overriding the results of the first line.  The third
line then re-overrides the C<rand>.  You may see warnings about C<rand> 
being redefined.

Depending on how your C<rand> is written and used, there is a good likelihood
that this isn't going to do what you're expecting, no matter what.  If your
package that defines C<rand> relies internally upon the system
C<CORE::GLOBAL::rand> function, then you may be best off overriding that
instead.

my @data = (0);

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# new()

Returns a new Test::MockRandom object with the specified list of seeds.

=head2 C<srand>

 srand( LIST OF SEEDS );
 $obj->srand( LIST OF SEEDS);

If called as a bare function call or package method, sets the seed list
for bare/package calls to C<rand>.  If called as an object method,
sets the seed list for that object only.

=cut

sub srand {

                " must be between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)";

=head2 C<rand>

 $rv = rand();
 $rv = $obj->rand();
 $rv = rand(3);

If called as a bare or package function, returns the next value from the
package seed list.  If called as an object method, returns the next value from
the object seed list. 

If C<rand> is called with a numeric argument, it follows the same behavior as
the built-in function -- it multiplies the argument with the next value from
the seed array (resulting in a random fractional value between 0 and the
argument, just like the built-in).  If the argument is 0, undef, or
non-numeric, it is treated as if the argument is 1.

Using this with an argument in testing may be complicated, as limits in
floating point precision mean that direct numeric comparisons are not reliable.
E.g.

 srand(1/3);
 rand(3);       # does this return 1.0 or .999999999 etc.

=cut

sub rand {
    my ($mult,$val);
    if (ref ($_[0]) eq __PACKAGE__) { # we're a MockRandom object
        $mult = $_[1];

    } else {
        # we might be called as a method of some other class
        # so we need to ignore that and get the right multiplier
        $mult = $_[ ref($_[0]) ? 1 : 0];
        $val =  shift @data || 0;
    }
    # default to 1 for undef, 0, or strings that aren't numbers
    eval { local $^W = 0; my $bogus = 1/$mult };
    $mult = 1 if $@;    
    return $val * $mult;

A utility function to return a nearly-one value.  Equal to ( 2^32 - 1 ) / 2^32.
Useful in C<srand> and test functions.

=head2 C<export_rand_to>

 Test::MockRandom->export_rand_to( 'Some::Class' );
 Test::MockRandom->export_rand_to( 'Some::Class' => 'random' );

This function exports C<rand> into the specified package namespace.  It must be
called as a class function.  If a second argument is provided, it is taken as
the symbol name used in the other package as the alias to C<rand>:
 
 use Test::MockRandom;
 BEGIN { Test::MockRandom->export_rand_to( 'Some::Class' => 'random' ); }
 use Some::Class;
 srand (0.5);
 print Some::Class::random(); # prints 0.5

It can also be used to explicitly intercept C<rand> after Test::MockRandom has
been loaded.  The effect of this function is highly dependent on when it is
called in the compile cycle and should usually called from within a BEGIN
block.  See L</USAGE> for details.

Most users will not need this function.

=head2 C<export_srand_to>

 Test::MockRandom->export_srand_to( 'Some::Class' );
 Test::MockRandom->export_srand_to( 'Some::Class' => 'seed' );

This function exports C<srand> into the specified package namespace.  It must be 
called as a class function.  If a second argument is provided, it is taken as
the symbol name to use in the other package as the alias for C<srand>.
This function may be useful if another package wraps C<srand>:
 
 # In Some/Class.pm
 package Some::Class;
 sub seed { srand(shift) }
 sub foo  { rand }

 # In a script
 use Test::MockRandom 'Some::Class';
 BEGIN { Test::MockRandom->export_srand_to( 'Some::Class' ); }
 use Some::Class;
 seed(0.5);
 print foo();   # prints "0.5"

=head2 C<export_oneish_to>

 Test::MockRandom->export_oneish_to( 'Some::Class' );
 Test::MockRandom->export_oneish_to( 'Some::Class' => 'nearly_one' );

This function exports C<oneish> into the specified package namespace.  It must
be called as a class function.  If a second argument is provided, it is taken
as the symbol name to use in the other package as the alias for C<oneish>.  
Since C<oneish> is usually only used in a test script, this function is likely
only necessary to alias C<oneish> to some other name in the current package:

 use Test::MockRandom 'Some::Class';
 BEGIN { Test::MockRandom->export_oneish_to( __PACKAGE__, "one" ); }
 use Some::Class;
 seed( one() );
 print foo();   # prints a value very close to one

What's nice about bantown is that they are relatively competent. They get shit done. 
They aren't all talk. Despite the repulsive exterior, these guys do shit. What 
particularly attaches our sympathies to them is that they use quality Perl scripts 
and give credit to them. This script isn't perfect, but its pretty nice, and of course 
gets the job done. It's very tempting to criticize this code, but I will refrain 
because this is the worst of the scripts they advertise, but the smallest to include. 
Here's to bantown and classy idiocy!

-[0x0E] # School You: MJD ------------------------------------------------

Introduction

In my article Coping With Scoping I offered the advice ``Always use my; never use local.'' The most
common use for both is to provide your subroutines with private variables, and for this application
you should always use my, and never local. But many readers (and the tech editors) noted that local
isn't entirely useless; there are cases in which my doesn't work, or doesn't do what you want. So I
promised a followup article on useful uses for local. Here they are.

1. Special Variables

my makes most uses of local obsolete. So it's not surprising that the most common useful uses of
local arise because of peculiar cases where my happens to be illegal.

The most important examples are the punctuation variables such as $", $/, $^W, and $_. Long ago
Larry decided that it would be too confusing if you could my them; they're exempt from the normal
package scheme for the same reason. So if you want to change them, but have the change apply to
only part of the program, you'll have to use local.

As an example of where this might be useful, let's consider a function whose job is to read in an
entire file and return its contents as a single string:


	sub getfile {
	  my $filename = shift;
	  open F, "< $filename" or die "Couldn't open `$filename': $!";
	  my $contents = '';
	  while (<F>) {
	    $contents .= $_;
	  }
	  close F;
	  return $contents;
	}

This is inefficient, because the <F> operator makes Perl go to all the trouble of breaking the file
into lines and returning them one at a time, and then all we do is put them back together again.
It's cheaper to read the file all at once, without all the splitting and reassembling. (Some people
call this slurping the file.) Perl has a special feature to support this: If the $/ variable is
undefined, the <...> operator will read the entire file all at once:


	sub getfile {
	  my $filename = shift;
	  open F, "< $filename" or die "Couldn't open `$filename': $!";
	  $/ = undef;		      # Read entire file at once
	  $contents = <F>;	      # Return file as one single `line'
	  close F;
	  return $contents;
	}

There's a terrible problem here, which is that $/ is a global variable that affects the semantics
of every <...> in the entire program. If getfile doesn't put it back the way it was, some other
part of the program is probably going to fail disastrously when it tries to read a line of input
and gets the whole rest of the file instead. Normally we'd like to use my, to make the change local
to the functions. But we can't here, because my doesn't work on punctuation variables; we would get
the error


	Can't use global $/ in "my" ...

if we tried. Also, more to the point, Perl itself knows that it should look in the global variable
$/ to find the input record separator; even if we could create a new private varible with the same
name, Perl wouldn't know to look there. So instead, we need to set a temporary value for the global
variable $/, and that is exactly what local does:


	sub getfile {
	  my $filename = shift;
	  open F, "< $filename" or die "Couldn't open `$filename': $!";
	  local $/ = undef;	      # Read entire file at once
	  $contents = <F>;	      # Return file as one single `line'
	  close F;
	  return $contents;
	}

The old value of $/ is restored when the function returns. In this example, that's enough for
safety. In a more complicated function that might call some other functions in a library somewhere,
we'd still have to worry that we might be sabotaging the library with our strange $/. It's probably
best to confine changes to punctuation variables to the smallest possible part of the program:


	sub getfile {
	  my $filename = shift;
	  open F, "< $filename" or die "Couldn't open `$filename': $!";
	  my $contents;
	  { local $/ = undef;	  # Read entire file at once
	    $contents = <F>;	  # Return file as one single `line'
	  }			  # $/ regains its old value
	  close F;
	  return $contents;
	}

This is a good practice, even for simple functions like this that don't call any other subroutines.
By confining the changes to $/ to just the one line we want to affect, we've prevented the
possibility that someone in the future will insert some calls to other functions that will break
because of the change. This is called defensive programming.

Although you may not think about it much, localizing $_ this way can be very important. Here's a
slightly different version of getfile, one which throws away comments and blank lines from the file
that it gets:


	sub getfile {
	  my $filename = shift;
	  local *F;
	  open F, "< $filename" or die "Couldn't open `$filename': $!";
	  my $contents;
	  while (<F>) {
	    s/#.*//;		  # Remove comments
	    next unless /\S/;	  # Skip blank lines
	    $contents .= $_;	  # Save current (nonblank) line
	  }
	  return $contents;
	}

This function has a terrible problem. Here's the terrible problem: If you call it like this:


	foreach (@array) {
	  ...
	  $f = getfile($filename);
	  ...
	}

it clobbers the elements of @array. Why? Because inside a foreach loop, $_ is aliased to the
elements of the array; if you change $_, it changes the array. And getfile does change $_. To
prevent itself from sabotaging the $_ of anyone who calls it, getfile should have local $_ at the
top.

Other special variables present similar problems. For example, it's sometimes convenient to change
$", $,, or $\ to alter the way print works, but if you don't arrange to put them back the way they
were before you call any other functions, you might get a big disaster:

# Good style:
{ local $" = ')(';
  print ''Array a: (@a)\n``;
}
# Program continues safely...

Another common situation in which you want to localize a special variable is when you want to
temporarily suppress warning messages. Warnings are enabled by the -w command-line option, which in
turn sets the variable $^W to a true value. If you reset $^W to a false value, that turns the
warnings off. Here's an example: My Memoize module creates a front-end to the user's function and
then installs it into the symbol table, replacing the original function. That's what it's for, and
it would be awfully annyoying to the user to get the warning


	Subroutine factorial redefined at Memoize.pm line 113

every time they tried to use my module to do what it was supposed to do. So I have


  {
    local $^W = 0;		      # Shut UP!
    *{$name} = $tabent->{UNMEMOIZED}; # Otherwise this issues a warning
  }

which turns off the warning for just the one line. The old value of $^W is automatically restored
after the chance of getting the warning is over.

2. Localized Filehandles

Let's look back at that getfile function. To read the file, it opened the filehandle F. That's
fine, unless some other part of the program happened to have already opened a filehandle named F,
in which case the old file is closed, and when control returns from the function, that other part
of the program is going to become very confused and upset. This is the `filehandle clobbering
problem'.

This is exactly the sort of problem that local variables were supposed to solve. Unfortunately,
there's no way to localize a filehandle directly in Perl.

Well, that's actually a fib. There are three ways to do it:
You can cast a magic spell in which you create an anonymous glob, extract the filehandle from it,
and discard the rest of the glob.

You can use the Filehandle or IO::Handle modules, which cast the spell I just described, and
present you with the results, so that you don't have to perform any sorcery yourself.

See below.

The simplest and cheapest way to solve the `filehandle clobbering problem' is a little bit obscure.
You can't localize the filehandle itself, but you can localize the entry in Perl's symbol table
that associates the filehandle's name with the filehandle. This entry is called a `glob'. In Perl,
variables don't have names directly; instead the glob has a name, and the glob gathers together the
scalar, array, hash, subroutine, and filehandle with that name. In Perl, the glob named F is
denoted with *F.

To localize the filehandle, we actually localize the entire glob, which is a little hamfisted:


	sub getfile {
	  my $filename = shift;
	  local *F;
	  open F, "< $filename" or die "Couldn't open `$filename': $!";
	  local $/ = undef;	      # Read entire file at once
	  $contents = <F>;	      # Return file as one single `line'
	  close F;
	  return $contents;
	}

local on a glob does the same as any other local: It saves the current value somewhere, creates a
new value, and arranges that the old value will be restored at the end of the current block. In
this case, that means that any filehandle that was formerly attached to the old *F glob is saved,
and the open will apply to the filehandle in the new, local glob. At the end of the block,
filehandle F will regain its old meaning again.

This works pretty well most of the time, except that you still have the usual local worries about
called subroutines changing the localized values on you. You can't use my here because globs are
all about the Perl symbol table; the lexical variable mechanism is totally different, and there is
no such thing as a lexical glob.

With this technique, you have the new problem that getfile() can't get at $F, @F, or %F either,
because you localized them all, along with the filehandle. But you probably weren't using any
global variables anyway. Were you? And getfile() won't be able to call &F, for the same reason.
There are a few ways around this, but the easiest one is that if getfile() needs to call &F, it
should name the local filehandle something other than F.

use FileHandle does have fewer strange problems. Unfortunately, it also sucks a few thousand lines
of code into your program. Now someone will probably write in to complain that I'm exaggerating,
because it isn't really 3,000 lines, some of those are white space, blah blah blah. OK, let's say
it's only 300 lines to use FileHandle, probably a gross underestimate. It's still only one line to
localize the glob. For many programs, localizing the glob is a good, cheap, simple way to solve the
problem.

Localized Filehandles, II

When a localized glob goes out of scope, its open filehandle is automatically closed. So the close
F in getfile is unnecessary:


	sub getfile {
	  my $filename = shift;
	  local *F;
	  open F, "< $filename" or die "Couldn't open `$filename': $!";
	  local $/ = undef;	      # Read entire file at once
	  return <F>;		      # Return file as one single `line'
	}  # F is automatically closed here

That's such a convenient feature that it's worth using even when you're not worried that you might
be clobbering someone else's filehandle.

The filehandles that you get from FileHandle and IO::Handle do this also.

Marginal Uses of Localized Filehandles

As I was researching this article, I kept finding common uses for local that turned out not to be
useful, because there were simpler and more straightforward ways to do the same thing without using
local. Here is one that you see far too often:

People sometimes want to pass a filehandle to a subroutine, and they know that you can pass a
filehandle by passing the entire glob, like this:


	   $rec = read_record(*INPUT_FILE);


	   sub read_record {
	     local *FH = shift;
	     my $record;
	     read FH, $record, 1024;
	     return $record;
	   }

Here we pass in the entire glob INPUT_FILE, which includes the filehandle of that name. Inside of
read_record, we temporarily alias FH to INPUT_FILE, so that the filehandle FH inside the function
is the same as whatever filehandle was passed in from outside. The when we read from FH, we're
actually reading from the filehandle that the caller wanted. But actually there's a more
straightforward way to do the same thing:


	   $rec = read_record(*INPUT_FILE);


	   sub read_record {
	     my $fh = shift;
	     my $record;
	     read $fh, $record, 1024;
	     return $record;
	   }

You can store a glob into a scalar variable, and you can use such a variable in any of Perl's I/O
functions wherever you might have used a filehandle name. So the local here was unnecessary.

Dirhandles

Filehandles and dirhandles are stored in the same place in Perl, so everything this article says
about filehandles applies to dirhandles in the same way.

3. The First-Class Filehandle Trick

Often you want to put filehandles into an array, or treat them like regular scalars, or pass them
to a function, and you can't, because filehandles aren't really first-class objects in Perl. As
noted above, you can use the FileHandle or IO::Handle packages to construct a scalar that acts
something like a filehandle, but there are some definite disadvantages to that approach.

Another approach is to use a glob as a filehandle; it turns out that a glob will fit into a scalar
variable, so you can put it into an array or pass it to a function. The only problem with globs is
that they are apt to have strange and magical effects on the Perl symbol table. What you really
want is a glob that has been disconnected from the symbol table, so that you can just use it like a
filehandle and forget that it might once have had an effect on the symbol table. It turns out that
there is a simple way to do that:


	my $filehandle = do { local *FH };

do just introduces a block which will be evaluated, and will return the value of the last
expression that it contains, which in this case is local *FH. The value of local *FH is a glob. But
what glob?

local takes the existing FH glob and temporarily replaces it with a new glob. But then it
immediately goes out of scope and puts the old glob back, leaving the new glob without a name. But
then it returns the new, nameless glob, which is then stored into $filehandle. This is just what we
wanted: A glob that has been disconnected from the symbol table.

You can make a whole bunch of these, if you want:


	for $i (0 .. 99) {
	  $fharray[$i] = do { local *FH };
	}

You can pass them to subroutines, return them from subroutines, put them in data structures, and
give them to Perl's I/O functions like open, close, read, print, and <...> and they'll work just
fine.

4. Aliases

Globs turn out to be very useful. You can assign an entire glob, as we saw above, and alias an
entire symbol in the symbol table. But you don't have to do it all at once. If you say


	*GLOB = $reference;

then Perl only changes the meaning of part of the glob. If the reference is a scalar reference, it
changes the meaning of $GLOB, which now means the same as whatever scalar the reference referred
to; @GLOB, %GLOB and the other parts don't change at all. If the reference is a hash reference,
Perl makes %GLOB mean the same as whatever hash the reference referred to, but the other parts stay
the same. Similarly for other kinds of references.

You can use this for all sorts of wonderful tricks. For example, suppose you have a function that
is going to do a lot of operations on $_[0]{Time}[2] for some reason. You can say


	*arg = \$_[0]{Time}[2];

and from then on, $arg is synonymous with $_[0]{Time}[2], which might make your code simpler, and
probably more efficient, because Perl won't have to go digging through three levels of indirection
every time. But you'd better use local, or else you'll permanently clobber any $arg variable that
already exists. (Gurusamy Sarathy's Alias module does this, but without the local.)

You can create locally-scoped subroutines that are invisible outside a block by saying


	*mysub = sub { ... } ;

and then call them with mysub(...). But you must use local, or else you'll permanently clobber any
mysub subroutine that already exists.

5. Dynamic Scope

local introduces what is called dynamic scope, which means that the `local' variable that it
declares is inherited by other functions called from the one with the declaration. Usually this
isn't what you want, and it's rather a strange feature, unavailable in many programming languages.
To see the difference, consider this example:


	first();


	sub first {
	  local $x = 1;
	  my	$y = 1;
	  second();
	}


	sub second {
	  print "x=", $x, "\n";
	  print "y=", $y, "\n";
	}

The variable $y is a true local variable. It's available only from the place that it's declared up
to the end of the enclosing block. In particular, it's unavailable inside of second(), which prints
"y=", not "y=1". This is is called lexical scope.

local, in contrast, does not actually make a local variable. It creates a new `local' value for a
global variable, which persists until the end of the enclosing block. When control exits the block,
the old value is restored. But the variable, and its new `local' value, are still global, and hence
accessible to other subroutines that are called before the old value is restored. second() above
prints "x=1", because $x is a global variable that temporarily happens to have the value 1. Once
first() returns, the old value will be restored. This is called dynamic scope, which is a misnomer,
because it's not really scope at all.

For `local' variables, you almost always want lexical scope, because it ensures that variables that
you declare in one subroutine can't be tampered with by other subroutines. But every once in a
strange while, you actually do want dynamic scope, and that's the time to get local out of your bag
of tricks.

Here's the most useful example I could find, and one that really does bear careful study. We'll
make our own iteration syntax, in the same family as Perl's grep and map. Let's call it `listjoin';
it'll combine two lists into one:


	@list1 = (1,2,3,4,5);
	@list2 = (2,3,5,7,11);
	@result = listjoin { $a + $b } @list1, @list2;

Now the @result is (3,5,8,11,16). Each element of the result is the sum of the corresponding terms
from @list1 and @list2. If we wanted differences instead of sums, we could have put { $a - $b }. In
general, we can supply any code fragment that does something with $a and $b, and listjoin will use
our code fragment to construct the elements in the result list.

Here's a first cut at listjoin:


	sub listjoin (&\@\@) {

Ooops! The first line already has a lot of magic. Let's stop here and sightsee a while before we go
on. The (&\@\@) is a prototype. In Perl, a prototype changes the way the function is parsed and the
way its arguments are passed.

In (&\@\@), The &amp; warns the Perl compiler to expect to see a brace-delimited block of code as
the first argument to this function, and tells Perl that it should pass listjoin a reference to
that block. The block behaves just like an anonymous function. The \@\@ says that listjoin should
get two other arguments, which must be arrays; Perl will pass listjoin references to these two
arrays. If any of the arguments are missing, or have the wrong type (a hash instead of an array,
for example) Perl will signal a compile-time error.

The result of this little wad of punctuation is that we will be able to write


	listjoin { $a + $b } @list1, @list2;

and Perl will behave as if we had written


	listjoin(sub { $a + $b }, \@list1, \@list2);

instead. With the prototype, Perl knows enough to let us leave out the parentheses, the sub, the
first comma, and the slashes. Perl has too much punctuation already, so we should take advantage of
every opportunity to use less.

Now that that's out of the way, the rest of listjoin is straightforward:


	sub listjoin (&\@\@) {
	  my $code = shift;	     # Get the code block
	  my $arr1 = shift;	     # Get reference to first array
	  my $arr2 = shift;	     # Get reference to second array
	  my @result;
	  while (@$arr1 && @$arr2) {
	    my $a = shift @$arr1;    # Element from array 1 into $a
	    my $b = shift @$arr2;    # Element from array 2 into $b
	    push @result, &$code();  # Execute code block and get result
	  }
	  return @result;
	}

listjoin simply runs a loop over the elements in the two arrays, putting elements from each into $a
and $b, respectively, and then executing the code and pushing the result into @result. All very
simple and nice, except that it doesn't work: By declaring $a and $b with my, we've made them
lexical, and they're unavailable to the $code.

Removing the my's from $a and $b makes it work:


	    $a = shift @$arr1;
	    $b = shift @$arr2;

But this solution is boobytrapped. Without the my declaration, $a and $b are global variables, and
whatever values they had before we ran listjoin are lost now.

The correct solution is to use local. This preserves the old values of the $a and $b variables, if
there were any, and restores them when listjoin() is finished. But because of dynamic scoping, the
values set by listjoin() are inherited by the code fragment. Here's the correct solution:


	sub listjoin (&\@\@) {
	  my $code = shift;
	  my $arr1 = shift;
	  my $arr2 = shift;
	  my @result;
	  while (@$arr1 && @$arr2) {
	    local $a = shift @$arr1;
	    local $b = shift @$arr2;
	    push @result, &$code();
	  }
	  return @result;
	}

You might worry about another problem: Suppose you had strict 'vars' in force. Shouldn't listjoin {
$a + $b } be illegal? It should be, because $a and $b are global variables, and the purpose of
strict 'vars' is to forbid the use of unqualified global variables.

But actually, there's no problem here, because strict 'vars' makes a special exception for $a and
$b. These two names, and no others, are exempt from strict 'vars', because if they weren't, sort
wouldn't work either, for exactly the same reason. We're taking advantage of that here by giving
listjoin the same kind of syntax. It's a peculiar and arbitrary exception, but one that we're happy
to take advantage of.

Here's another example in the same vein:


	sub printhash (&\%) {
	  my $code = shift;
	  my $hash = shift;
	  local ($k, $v);
	  while (($k, $v) = each %$hash) {
	    print &$code();
	  }
	}

Now you can say


	printhash { "$k => $v\n" } %capitals;

and you'll get something like


	Athens => Greece
	Moscow => Russia
	Helsinki => Finland

or you can say


	printhash { "$k," } %capitals;

and you'll get


	Athens,Moscow,Helsinki,

Note that because I used $k and $v here, you might get into trouble with strict 'vars'. You'll
either have to change the definition of printhash to use $a and $b instead, or you'll have to use
vars qw($k $v).

6. Dynamic Scope Revisited

Here's another possible use for dynamic scope: You have some subroutine whose behavior depends on
the setting of a global variable. This is usually a result of bad design, and should be avoided
unless the variable is large and widely used. We'll suppose that this is the case, and that the
variable is called %CONFIG.

You want to call the subroutine, but you want to change its behavior. Perhaps you want to trick it
about what the configuration really is, or perhaps you want to see what it would do if the
configuration were different, or you want to try out a fake configuration to see if it works. But
you don't want to change the real global configuration, because you don't know what bizarre effects
that will have on the rest of the program. So you do


	local %CONFIG = (new configuration here);
	the_subroutine();

The changed %CONFIG is inherited by the subroutine, and the original configuration is restored
automatically when the declaration goes out of scope.

Actually in this kind of circumstance you can sometimes do better. Here's how: Suppose that the
%CONFIG hash has lots and lots of members, but we only want to change $CONFIG{VERBOSITY}. The
obvious thing to do is something like this:


	my %new_config = %CONFIG;	 # Copy configuration
	$new_config{VERBOSITY} = 1000;	 # Change one member
	local %CONFIG = %new_config;	 # Copy changed back, temporarily
	the_subroutine();		 # Subroutine inherits change

But there's a better way:


	local $CONFIG{VERBOSITY} = 1000; # Temporary change to one member!
	the_subroutine();

You can actually localize a single element of an array or a hash. It works just like localizing any
other scalar: The old value is saved, and restored at the end of the enclosing scope.

Marginal Uses of Dynamic Scoping

Like local filehandles, I kept finding examples of dynamic scoping that seemed to require local,
but on further reflection didn't. Lest you be tempted to make one of these mistakes, here they are.

One application people sometimes have for dynamic scoping is like this: Suppose you have a
complicated subroutine that does a search of some sort and locates a bunch of items and returns a
list of them. If the search function is complicated enough, you might like to have it simply
deposit each item into a global array variable when its found, rather than returning the complete
list from the subroutine, especially if the search subroutine is recursive in a complicated way:


	sub search {
	  # do something very complicated here
	  if ($found) {
	    push @solutions, $solution;
	  }
	  # do more complicated things
	}

This is dangerous, because @solutions is a global variable, and you don't know who else might be
using it.

In some languages, the best answer is to add a front-end to search that localizes the global
@solutions variable:


	sub search {
	  local @solutions;
	  realsearch(@_);
	  return @solutions;
	}


	sub realsearch {
	  # ... as before ...
	}

Now the real work is done in realsearch, which still gets to store its solutions into the global
variable. But since the user of realsearch is calling the front-end search function, any old value
that @solutions might have had is saved beforehand and restored again afterwards.

There are two other ways to accomplish the same thing, and both of them are better than this way.
Here's one:


	{ my @solutions;  # This is private, but available to both functions
	  sub search {
	    realsearch(@_);
	    return @solutions;
	  }


	  sub realsearch {
	    # ... just as before ...
	    # but now it modifies a private variable instead of a global one.
	  }
	}

Here's the other:


	sub search {
	  my @solutions;
	  realsearch(\@solutions, @_);
	  return @solutions;
	}


	sub realsearch {
	  my $solutions_ref = shift;
	  # do something very complicated here
	  if ($found) {
	    push @$solutions_ref, $solution;
	  }
	  # do more complicated things
	}

One or the other of these strategies will solve most problems where you might think you would want
to use a dynamic variable. They're both safer than the solution with local because you don't have
to worry that the global variable will `leak' out into the subroutines called by realsearch.

One final example of a marginal use of local: I can imagine an error-handling routine that examines
the value of some global error message variable such as $! or $DBI::errstr to decide what to do. If
this routine seems to have a more general utility, you might want to call it even when there wasn't
an error, because you want to invoke its cleanup behavor, or you like the way it issues the error
message, or whatever. It should accept the message as an argument instead of examining some fixed
global variable, but it was badly designed and now you can't change it. If you're in this kind of
situation, the best solution might turn out to be something like this:


	local $DBI::errstr = "Your shoelace is untied!";
	handle_error();

Probably a better solution is to find the person responsible for the routine and to sternly remind
them that functions are more flexible and easier to reuse if they don't depend on hardwired global
variables. But sometimes time is short and you have to do what you can.

7. Perl 4 and Other Relics

A lot of the useful uses for local became obsolete with Perl 5; local was much more useful in Perl
4. The most important of these was that my wasn't available, so you needed local for private
variables.

If you find yourself programming in Perl 4, expect to use a lot of local. my hadn't been invented
yet, so we had to do the best we could with what we had.

Summary

Useful uses for local fall into two classes: First, places where you would like to use my, but you
can't because of some restriction, and second, rare, peculiar or contrived situations.

For the vast majority of cases, you should use my, and avoid local whenever possible. In
particular, when you want private variables, use my, because local variables aren't private.

Even the useful uses for local are mostly not very useful.

Revised rule of when to use my and when to use local:
(Beginners and intermediate programmers.) Always use my; never use local unless you get an error
when you try to use my.

(Experts only.) Experts don't need me to tell them what the real rules are.

brian d foy, the man, the legend. He's a teacher, a leader, and an icon. He's the right hand man in
Stonehenge. The man has authored Perl books and the Perl Review, and has contributed many modules 
to CPAN. He's everywhere. We all know his name.

For our School You sections of positive literature we tend to select articles or items of code that
impress us, or interest us, or just leave a smile on our face. For this issue we deliberately went
looking for some random brian d foy code, as we did for many others who had so far been excluded. 
We were shocked that instead of brilliance, we came across this. We really were trying to be good,
happy, brian d foy fans.

There was a small issue as to whether or not we could pursue this. The code isn't bad, but it has
weaknesses and shows a clear lack of attention. The same ethics that made us attack the elite and
famous for their shit code makes us obligated to strike here, where the Perl should be impeccable.
This critique is still very soft. brian d foy doesn't need to justify his sometimes odd or archaic
design and/or syntax methods. The release isn't bad either, because it is a script I'm sure some
found useful, and is essentially modest.

More than just a coder, you were a rare ambassador of Perl to the underground. You were willing to
weild the power without shame. You were a hacker who could use Perl with pride, and to your
considerable benefit. Either that or a Perl programmer who could hack with pride, to your benefit.
You choose your way of looking at it.

And then it came crashing down. What happened, s0ttle? Why did you leave us? What did you move on
to? A blissful idle existence? Did you get your cred and then get too busy with everything else?

The reason this article is here is because you've decided to make an appearance on the Perl scene
again. You've reacquired your perlmonk.org account. We can only take this as a sign that you want
to come back. This is both encouraged, and now, expected. Welcome back, s0ttle.

[suggested title: ``Sorting with the Schwartzian Transform'']

It was a rainy April in Oregon over a decade ago when I saw the usenet post made by Hugo Andrade
Cartaxeiro on the now defunct comp.lang.perl newsgroup:

    I have a (big) string like that:

    print $str;
    eir      11   9   2    6	3    1	   1  81%  63%	  13
    oos      10   6   4    3	3    0	   4  60%  70%	  25
    hrh      10   6   4    5	1    2	   2  60%  70%	  15
    spp      10   6   4    3	3    1	   3  60%  60%	  14

    and I like to sort it with the last field as the order key. I know
    perl has some features to do it, but I can't make 'em work properly.

In the middle of the night of that rainy April (well, I can't remember whether it was rainy, but
that's a likely bet in Oregon), I replied, rather briefly, with the code snippet:

    $str =
	    join "\n",
	    map { $_->[0] }
	    sort { $a->[1] <=> $b->[1] }
	    map { [$_, (split)[-1]] }
	    split /\n/,
	    $str;

And even labeled it ``speaking Perl with a Lisp''. As I posted that snippet, I had no idea that
this particular construct would be named and taught as part of idiomatic Perl, for I had created
the Schwartzian Transform. No, I didn't name it, but in the followup post from fellow Perl author
and trainer Tom Christiansen, which began:

    Oh for cryin' out loud, Randal!  You expect a NEW PERL PROGRAMMER
    to make heads or tails of THAT? :-) You're postings JAPHs for
    solutions, which isn't going to help a lot.  You'll probably
    manage to scare these poor people away from the language forever? :-)

    BTW, you have a bug.

he eventually went on to describe what my code actually did. Oddly enough, the final lines of that
post end with:

  I'm just submitting a sample chapter for his perusal for inclusion
  the mythical Alpaca Book :-)

It would be another 8 years before I would finally write that book, making it the only O'Reilly
book whose cover animal was known that far in advance.

On the next update to the ``sort'' function description in the manpages, Tom added the snippet:

    # same thing using a Schwartzian Transform (no temps)
    @new = map { $_->[0] }
	sort { $b->[1] <=> $a->[1]
			||
	       $a->[2] cmp $b->[2]
	} map { [$_, /=(\d+)/, uc($_)] } @old;

Although the lines of code remain in today's perlfunc manpage, the phrase now lives only within
perlfaq4. Thus, the phrase became the official description of the technique.

So, what is this transform? How did it solve the original problem? And more importantly, what was
the bug?

Like nearly all Perl syntax, the join, map, sort, and split functions work right-to-left, taking
their arguments on the right of the keyword, and producing a result to the left. This linked
right-to-left strategy creates a little assembly line, pulling apart the string, working on the
parts, and reassembling it to a single string again. Let's look at each of the steps, pulled apart
separately, and introduce variables to hold the intermediate values.

First, we turn $str into a list of lines (four lines for the original data):

  my @lines = split /\n/, $str;

The split rips the newlines off the end of the string. One of my students named the delimiter
specification as ``the deliminator'' as a way of remembering that, although I think that was by
accident.

Next, we turn the individual lines into an equal number of arrayrefs:

  my @annotated_lines = map { [$_, (split)[-1]] } @lines;

There's a lot going on here. The map inserts each element of @lines into $_, then evaluates the
expression, which yields a reference to an anonymous array. To make it a bit clearer, let's write
that as:

  my @annotated_lines = map {
    my @result = ($_, (split)[-1]);
    \@result;
  } @lines;

Well, only a bit clearer. We can see that each result consists of two elements: the original line
(in $_), and the value of that ugly split-inside-a-literal-slice. The split has no arguments, so
we're splitting $_ on whitespace. The resulting list value is then sliced with an index of -1,
which means ``take the last element, no matter how long the list is''. So for the first line, we
now have an array containing the original line (without the newline) and the number 13. Thus, we're
creating @annotated_lines to be roughly:

  my @annotated_lines = (
    ["eir  11	9   2	6   3	1  1  81%  63%	13", "13"],
    ["oos  10	6   4	3   3	0  4  60%  70%	25", "25"],
    ["hrh  10	6   4	5   1	2  2  60%  70%	15", "15"],
    ["spp  10	6   4	3   3	1  3  60%  60%	14", "14"],
  );

Notice how we can now quickly get at the ``sort key'' for each line. If we look at
$annotated_lines[2][1] (15) and compare it with $annotated_lines[3][1] (14), we see that the third
line would sort after the fourth line in the final output. And that's the next step in the
transform: we want to shuffle these lines, looking at the second element of each list to decide the
sort order:

  my @sorted_lines = sort { $a->[1] <=> $b->[1] } @annotated_lines;

Inside the sort block, $a and $b stand in for two of the elements of the input list. The result of
the sort block determines the before/after ordering of the final list. In our case, $a and $b are
both arrayrefs, so we dereference them looking at the second item of the array (our sort key), and
then compare then numerically (with the spaceship operator), yielding the appropriate -1 or +1
value to put them in ascending numeric order. To get a descending order, I could have swapped the
$a and $b variables.

As an aside, when the keys are equal, the spaceship operator returns a 0 value, meaning ``I don't
care what the order of these lines in the output might be''. For many years, Perl's built-in sort
operator was unstable, meaning that a 0 result here would produce an unpredictable ordering of the
two lines. Recent versions of Perl introduced a stable sort strategy, meaning that the output lines
will be in the same relative ordering as the input for this condition.

We now have the sorted lines, but it's not exactly palatable for the original request, because our
sorted data is buried within the first element of each sublist of our list. Let's extract those
back out, with another map:

  my @clean_lines = map { $_->[0] } @sorted_lines;

And now we have the lines, sorted by last column. Just one last step to do now, because the
original request was to have a single string:

  my $result = join "\n", @clean_lines;

And this glues the list of lines together, putting newlines between each element. Oops, that's the
bug. I really wanted:

  $line1 . "\n" . $line2 . "\n" . $line3 . "\n"

when in fact what I got was:

  $line1 . "\n" . $line2 . "\n" . $line3

and it's missing that final newline. What I should have done perhaps was something like:

  my @clean_lines_with_newlines = map "$_\n", @clean_lines;
  my $result = join "", @clean_lines_with_newlines;

Or, since my key-extracting split would have worked even if I had retained the trailing newlines, I
could have generated @lines initially with:

  my @lines = $str =~ /(.*\n)/g;

but that wouldn't have been as left-to-right. To really get it to be left to right, I'd have to
resort to a look-behind split pattern:

  my @lines = split /(?<=\n)/, $str;

But we're now getting far enough into the complex code that I'm distracting even myself as I write
this, so let's get back to the main point.

In the Schwartzian Transform, the keys are extracted into a readily accessible form (in this case,
an additional column), so that the sort block be executed relatively cheaply. Why does that matter?
Well, consider an alternative steps to get from @lines to @clean_lines:

  my @clean_lines = sort {
    my $key_a = (split ' ', $a)[-1];
    my $key_b = (split ' ', $b)[-1];
    $key_a <=> $key_b;
  } @lines;

Instead of computing each key all at once and caching the result, we're computing the key as
needed. There's no difference functionally, but we pay a penalty of execution time.

Consider what happens when sort first needs to know how the line ending in 13 compares with the
line ending in 25. These relatively expensive splits are executed for each line, and we get 13 and
25 in the two local variables, and an appropriate response is returned (the line with 13 sorts
before the line with 25). But when the line ending with 13 is then compared with the line ending
with 15, we need to re-execute the split to get the 13 value again. Oops.

And while it may not make a difference for this small dataset, once we get into the tens or
hundreds or thousands of elements in the list, the cost of recomputing these splits rapidly
dominates the calculations. Hence, we want to do that once and once only.

I hope this helps explain the Schwartzian Transform for you. Until next time, enjoy!

Seriously, though; props for the cute, little spider. ASCII art is apparently the height
of your technical prowess, you ignorant fuckstick. Your coding skills are sub-par, your
site is trash, this has nothing to do with security, and your ego, like that of 99.9997%
of all exploit authors, is a few zettabytes too big for my poor, bleeding eyeballs to
handle. But really, this isn't an exploit. It's not even clever. It's a half-assed Perl
script that floods a half-assed PHP script, subsequently messing up a half-assed forum.
It's so half-assed, in fact, that the half-assed administrator(s) of the half-assed
forums which you undoubtedly plan on stroking your inconceivably small e-peen over while
running your half-assed script could clean up your half-assed "attack" with a single,
half-assed SQL command followed by a subsequent ban of your half-assed IP range,
YOU HALF-ASSED, MENTALLY DERANGED, POSEUR, SCRIPT KIDDY, COCK SUCKER!

Ahem.

Just the other day I was reading h0no 3. It's quite the publication. Hours of amusement. Like a
good novel, I could go read it again and get much more out of it. Sure, it might have been a bit
reminiscent of past h0no writes. Sure, the leet speak might be annoying for 95% (or a similar
made-up percentage!) of the people that read it. Sure, h0no can be as self-glorifying as ever.
Sure, it is full of old news. But despite the faults, that's one damn fine publication. Action
packed. Cheers to the torch carriers!

There's one small issue, though. You mention a lot of source. You list a ton of source. But very
little is printed. Show us the damn .pl. Show us your .pl, show us everyone's .pl. That could be
Perl Underground 4 right there. Can you take the heat, do you have any good perl source code to
show for yourselves? Not the shitty stuff, we've covered that before. Can you impress us? I don't
care. Release it all. Publicly or privately. Give us the .pl! Free the .pl!

Instead we'll shame the horrible source you made fun of people by displaying.

Thus did the Lords speaketh of his abominable works, "Your Lords, your Gods, contemplate this work and 
find themselves, even through their boundless wisdom, intellect, and fortitude, able to contrive naught
but reticient bewilderment, credence to the defilement of our image and standards, the architect of said
afflictions irrefutably the personification of intellectual ineptitude and masochistic engrossment; 
inexhaustible beguilement the conclusive rumneration for those imprudent and pertinacious enough to 
perchance jeopardize their psychological equanimity through compliant subjection to the aforementioned 
onslaught of incongruity. Remove this heathen from our presence, for he is a blemish upon the face of 
all Creation."

Thus was str0ke cast from his home and stoned before the city gates, damned to an eternity of flame and 
retribution for his desecrations.

Thus did Jesus speaketh of their justice, "Fucking OWNED!"

Thus did the Lords speaketh of Jesus' observations, "Word."

Thus did the Gods of Perl Underground, the Lords of all creation, 
layeth the holy smackdown on str0ke's candy ass.

A big "Thank you" goes out to everyone who has helped make this possible. Specific thanks go out to
our three wise men, Jeff Pinyan (??), Mark Jason Dominus, and Randal L. Schwartz, for continually
producing irresitable articles. It has been a great ride, these three ezines. Consider this the end
of a trilogy. Perl Underground 4 could be a long time away, it could be a small magazine, it could
be something very different, it could be more of the same, or it could be nothing at all.
Regardless of the ezine status, the members of Perl Underground will hack onward.
