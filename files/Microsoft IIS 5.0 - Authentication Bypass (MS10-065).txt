MS10-065 - Directory Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Description:
This vulnerability is because of using Alternate Data Stream to open a protected folder. All of IIS
authentication methods can be circumvented. In this technique, we can add a “:$i30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION” to a directory name to bypass the authentication.
