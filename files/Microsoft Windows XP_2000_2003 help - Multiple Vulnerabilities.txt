The Microsoft Windows Help File viewer (winhlp32.exe) is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities present themselves when the application handles specially crafted Windows Help (.hlp) files.

A successful attack may let the attacker crash the application or execute arbitrary code in the context of a vulnerable user who opens a malicious file.

Specific information regarding affected versions of Microsoft Windows is currently unavailable.

Update: Since help files can inherently execute arbitrary malicious code, this BID is being retired.
