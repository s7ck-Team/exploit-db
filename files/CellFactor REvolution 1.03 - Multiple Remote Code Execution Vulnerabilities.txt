CellFactor: Revolution is prone to multiple remote code-execution vulnerabilities, including a buffer-overflow issue and a format-string issue.

Successfully exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application or to crash the application.

CellFactor: Revolution 1.03 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
