Unreal Tournament 2004 is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to handle NULL-pointer exceptions.

An attacker could exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users.

This issue affects Unreal Tournament 2004 v3369 and prior versions.
