Symantec 'SYMTDI.SYS' device driver is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability.

A local authenticated attacker may exploit this issue to crash affected computers, denying service to legitimate users.

This issue is similar to the one described in BID 22961. Symantec is currently investigating this issue; we will update this BID as more information emerges.
