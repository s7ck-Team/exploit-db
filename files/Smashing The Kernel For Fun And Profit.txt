	 	 -= Smashing The Kernel For Fun And Profit =-
		     by Dark-Angel <DarkAngel@antifork.org>


-=0x0=- Requirements

	- A 2.4.x kernel



-=0x1=-	Introduction:

	Today the net offers us a lot of pseudo-tools that work as processes
	hiders but, as well known, they are far to be perfect. Let's start for
	example with a classic binary-trojan: running strace we'll notice
	immediately that there's something that needs our attention. At the
	end, in more or less twenty seconds (in the evenience the sysadmin is
	quite unwise) we would find ourselves out of our preferred system.
	We can reach fourty seconds if we are planning to use kernel-tools,
	like the famous knark and adore, but, on my opinion, that is too less
	time to work in peace :-)
	In the article that follows I'll show you a technique that allows you
	to remain into a system for enough time or to give a sysadmin a
	terrible headache.

-=0x2=-	A little base:

	In this paragraph I'll try to give you an idea of the basics that you
	must know in order to undestand the following article.
	Every process is stored in the memory under the form of a struct named
	task_struct, defined in linux/sched.h, and all the processes of the
	system are present in a double linked list of these task_struct.
	When we attempt to execute a command from our favourite shell, more or
	less this is what happens:
	
		- sys_fork is called to fork the current process (the current
		  struct, the shell). The call creates an exact copy of the
		  struct and links it to the list

		- sys_execve is called to overwrite the newborn PCB (Process
		  Control Block, the task_struct) with the infos of the new
		  process

	[1] Another concept that you must know in order to proceed with reading
	is what is the scheduler, which is its function and how it works.
	On multiprogrammed systems  processes won't be executed till the end
	one by one (as in DOS), the machine compute for a determined time a
	task before switching to another. Scheduler may be definied as the
	algorithm that the o.s. execute in order to choose wich process can
	use the cpu.
	Obviously, the end of the quantum of one process isn't the only thing
	that makes necessary to call the scheduler.
	Another thing you must know is what are the epochs. An epoch is the
	period of time that all the processes employ to exaust their time
	quantums. If a process finishes its quantum, it will have to wait until the
	end of the epoch to obtain new cpu time. At the end of the epoch
	quantums are refreshed according to particular criteria we don't care.
	[2] The spinlocks are an expedient to avoid race conditions.
	They work through a shared variable: a function can obtain the lock
	setting a variable, and if another function had to demand the lock
	seeing it not avaiable will "spin" in a busy/wait cycle until the
	obtainment of the lock. Spinlocks, instead of semaphores, can be used
	in interrupt context because the don't put a process to sleep.

-=0x3=- Let's go

	Well, now that we are made an idea of the things on which we will go to
	work we can begin. Our friends security tools and the operating system
	think that if a process is in execution must be on the process list...
	this is true only in part. The processes must be found on the list only
	when their goodness is estimated for the successive context switch 
	(that is the substitution of the process that can use the cpu). Once
	the process began to run we could unlink its PCB without system become
	aware of it if we put it at its place before the next check by the
	scheduler. When the scheduler is called in the moment of the analysys
	of the next process to execute can't be interrupted and no process
	(with the exception ofthe swapper) can run.
	Therefore if we were in a position to link a PCB to the list of the
	processes before the analysis from the scheduler, and to unlink it
	after the end always remaining in the ininterruttibile zone, we could
	carry the execution of a process without that it is present in the list
	and way totally stealth, infact it would become "present" when nothing
	can run and therefore to find it.
	Easy to tell, isn't it? Luckyly it's no too difficult to do :-)
	Now, looking at out scheduler source code that we can find in
	/usr/src/linux/kernel/sched.c we must find the point where the task
	list is checked to calculate the goodness of each process. Looking for
	the word "goodness" in the schedule() function we can find this piece
	of code:

	c=-1000;
	
	        list_for_each(tmp, &runqueue_head) {
        	   p = list_entry(tmp, struct task_struct, run_list);
	              if (can_schedule(p, this_cpu)) {
        	          int weight = goodness(p, this_cpu, prev->active_mm);
                	    if (weight > c)
                        	 c = weight, next = p;
		      }
		}

		if (unlikely(!c)) {
	           struct task_struct *p;
        	   spin_unlock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
	           read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
        	     for_each_task(p)
	                p->counter = (p->counter >> 1) + NICE_TO_TICKS(p->nice);
		   read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
		   spin_lock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
		   goto repeat_schedule;
		}

	The processes in memory are'nt linked only with the task_struct's list,
	but exist a list of struct list_head and every node of this list is
	"included" in a task_struct of the main list. The list_for_each
	function checks the runqueue list (made of list_head structs) and for
	each node it computes the correspective task_struct and its goodness.
	The " if(unlikely(!c)) {" code block is for the refresh of the time
	quantums if the epoch is ended. After this point there's the context
	switch, so it's here that we have to work.
	
	
-=0x4=-	The hook:


	To hook a function in the middle we'll have to use a little variant of
	the famous Silvio Cesare's technique, but don't worry, it's easy.
	Obviously, we'll have to execute extraneous code, and so we must:
		- backup some istructions
		- jump to our function
		- do the dirty job
		- execute the backupped istructions
		- return in the original funcion after the jump
		
	You notice yourself that the original function is never restored.
	Here a little example of this:


			     -=-=>DoubleChain.c<=-=-

	/* 
		DoubleChain, a simple function hooker
		by Dark-Angel <Dark0@angelfire.com>
	*/

	#define MODULE

	#include <linux/module.h>
	#define CODEJUMP 7
	#define BACKUP 7
	/* The number of the bytes to backup is variable (at least 7),
	the important thing  is never break an istruction

	static char backup_one[BACKUP+CODEJUMP]="\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90"

		printk("Function hooked successfully\n");
		asm volatile("mov %ebp,%esp;popl %esp;jmp backup_one);
	/*

	(Cenobite now) are always for the parameters pushing.Jumping away the
	function can't restore the stack, so we must do it by hand.
	With the jump we go to execute the backupped code and then we jump in
	the original function.
	*/
	}
	
	int init_module(void) {
	*(unsigned long *)&jump_code[1]=(unsigned long )cenobite;

	*(unsigned long *)&backup_one[BACKUP+1]=(unsigned long)(FIRST_ADDRESS+
								BACKUP);
	
	memory=(unsigned long *)FIRST_ADDRESS;
	memcpy(backup_one,memory,CODEBACK);
	memcpy(memory,jump_code,CODEJUMP);
	return 0;
	}

	void cleanup_module(void) {
		memcpy(memory,backup_one,BACKUP);
	}

	It's useless to say that with this trick we can hook pratically
	wichever thing in wichever place and taht we can modify the behavior of
	most syscalls without touching them, just playing with their
	sub-functions.


-=0x5=-	The application


	Well, to start we need the address of the "c=-1000" and that of the
	first instruction after the quantums refresh block. But why do we need
	the address of "c=-1000"? We need it because it's the firts thing
	before the list_for_each cycle and we can't risk to overwrite a part of
	this. Moreover we do not have no point of reference in order to find
	the addresses of where to go to overwrite and that assignment being
	constant is like a lighthouse in the storm :)
	Same thing for the second address we need, well look for the fist
	assignment after the quantums refresh block. On our box, we can proceed
	in this way: we put in front a asm volatile("nop;nop;nop;.........");
	to our instructions target, we make a partial recompilation of the
	kernel in order to generate a new vmlinux and through a
	objdump -dS vmlinux we can obtain one magnificent panoramic of
	instructions and addresses. 
	Naturally these addresses are only fictitious, but now that we can see
	where are the interesting points we can easyly study a sequence of
	istructions that we can use as pattern parsing /dev/kmem to get the
	addresses. Unlukyly the form in ams code of the firts lighthouse
	istructions and their dimension change from kernel to kernel, so
	we must find some standard asm lighthouse istructions, and then
	we'll have to deduct the right startpoint reasoning on opcodes and
	istructions sequences. Luckuly the others hook's dimensions seems to be
	constant. Here the code of a raw and badcoded (but quit affidable)
	memory parser that implements this "technique".

	Ok, now that we are able to hook the scheduler and to find addresses
	let's think about the processes. We want to handle a lot of hided
	processes so we'll have to use a separate list to link/unlink them.
	We'll use a fixed pointer as head of the list and when we will
	detect an hided process we will have to unlink them from the main
	list and put them in head of our list. As fixed pointer i've decided
	to use the field p_pptr of the swapper task_struct. At the end, if
	we have 2 hided processes the sitiation is this:


			   Next				Next
		First Proc ----->Second hided process -----|
		Hided					   |
		   ^					   |
		   |					   |
		   | Father (p_pptr)			   |
		   |					   |
		Swapper --------------------->init <-------|
				Next Process

	Swapper->p_pptr points to the first of the hided processes, and every
	hided process' next_task field points the next hidden process, except
	the last, which next_task field points to the init process. Naturally
	a for_each_task starting from swapper->p_pptr will reveal all the
	hidden tasks, but we could avoid this problem using an extern global
	pointer... Easy to implement by yourself, isn't it? ^_-
	Unluckyly nothing is for nothing: an implementation like this is
	cause of "some" problems, and the first of them is the sys_exit.
	When a process ends, its pcb must be unlinked from the list and this
	is done trough the REMOVE_LINKS macro, defined in
	/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sched.h
	Here is the code of this macro:

	#define REMOVE_LINKS(p) do { \
	        (p)->next_task->prev_task = (p)->prev_task; \
	        (p)->prev_task->next_task = (p)->next_task; \
		        if ((p)->p_osptr) \
		                (p)->p_osptr->p_ysptr = (p)->p_ysptr; \
		        if ((p)->p_ysptr) \
		                (p)->p_ysptr->p_osptr = (p)->p_osptr; \
		        else \
		                (p)->p_pptr->p_cptr = (p)->p_osptr; \
	        } while (0)

	As we can see from the 2nd and the 3rd line the struct is unlinked
	like in a normal list, but if the ending process is hidden the
	pointers are wrong, because we have swapper->p_pptr instead of
	p->prev_task->next_task. We can easyly correct this hooking on the
	end the exit_notify function and implementing a pointer corrector
	function. We'll hook the exit_notify and not the sys_exit because
	doing in this manneer we have the same effect without modifying
	any syscall. Always for this reason we have to hook a secondary
	function with its arguments coming from user space to comunicate
	with the module from userpsace.
	The other problem is bigger: how to detect and handle forked
	processes? Let me explain: monitoring the do_execve function we
	can detect any new process, and if it's hidden we can hide it. But
	think on a program like this:
		
			...
			int main(void) {
				fork();
				printf("Hello\n");
				return 0;
			}
			
	Here do_execve is called only one time, but we have two processes
	and both to hide. We can't hook the do_fork or working on the
	newforked pcb because this would alter the informations needed by
	an eventual execve (regs) and so would cause a system crash.
	Our only chance to detect these little bastards is to detect them
	runtime. To do this we must monitor a function that is called for
	every new process (like wake_up_process for example) or that works
	often with all processes....:)
	Yes, you're right, the scheduler is still in our hands and so we
	can abuse another time of it }:)

	- You can't thide the working shell from itself (from another is ok)

	- Programs that forks many times in many diffrent process may crash or
	  block (for example updatedb)

	- You remember to use the special function of Heider.c to kill a
	  thided process

	- If you want the module to not taint the kernel you have to add the
	  MODULE_LICENSE("GPL"); string after the cleanup module
