html2hdml is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is exposed when converting HTML files to HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language). Since HTML files may originate from an external or untrusted source, this vulnerability is considered remote in nature.

Successful exploitation may result in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application.
