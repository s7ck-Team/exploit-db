Freeform Interactive Purge and Purge Jihad game clients have been reported prone to a remotely exploitable buffer overflow condition.

The issue presents itself in the client network connection routines used by the client to negotiate a connection to a Purge/Purge Jihad game server. A malicious game server may exploit this condition to potentially corrupt sensitive process memory in the affected game client and ultimately execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who invoked the game.
