J. River Media Jukebox is prone to a remote heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Media Jukebox 12 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
