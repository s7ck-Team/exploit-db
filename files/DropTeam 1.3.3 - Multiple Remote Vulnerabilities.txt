DropTeam is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities including multiple format-string issues, a stack-based buffer-overflow issue, multiple heap-based buffer-overflow issues, and an information-disclosure vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application, crash the application, and obtain sensitive information.

These issues affect DropTeam 1.3.3; other versions may also be affected.
