Call of Duty is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to handle specially crafted commands.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users.

Call of Duty 4 1.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
