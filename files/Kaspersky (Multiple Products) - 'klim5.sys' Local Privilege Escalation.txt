Multiple Kaspersky products are prone to a local privilege-escalation vulnerability because the applications fail to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

A local attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. Successfully exploiting this issue will result in the complete compromise of affected computers. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

This issue affects versions in the following product groups:

Kaspersky AV 2008
Kaspersky AV for WorkStations 6.0
