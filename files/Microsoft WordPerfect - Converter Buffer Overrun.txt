The Microsoft WordPerfect Converter, which ships with Office and a number of other products, is prone to a buffer overrun vulnerability. This could result in execution of malicious, attacker-supplied code when a document with malformed parameters is processed by the component. Exploitation would permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the malformed document.
