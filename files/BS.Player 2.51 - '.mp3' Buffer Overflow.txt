BS.Player is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

BS.Player 2.51 Build 1022 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
