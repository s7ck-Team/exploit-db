abc2ps and jcabc2ps are prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is exposed when the program is used to process the voice field in ABC music notation files. Since the ABC files may originate from an external or untrusted source, this issue is considered remote in nature.

Successful exploitation will result in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application.
